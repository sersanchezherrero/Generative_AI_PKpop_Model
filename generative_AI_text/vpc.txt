1. How can I perform a Monte Carlo simulation with variability in the parameters?
•	Reason for asking: The new code introduces a Monte Carlo simulation for 1000 patients, generating random values for pharmacokinetic parameters (Cl, Q, Vc, Vp) to reflect interindividual variability. This is key for simulating different patient responses.
2. How can I generate random parameter values with specific means and standard deviations?
•	Reason for asking: The new code uses normal distributions (rnorm) to generate random samples for Cl, Q, Vc, and Vp. Asking this will help you learn how to incorporate variability into the model parameters.
3. How can I integrate and visualize experimental data alongside my simulation?
•	Reason for asking: The new code loads additional experimental data from a CSV file and overlays it on the simulation plot. This allows you to compare the simulated data with real-world observations.
4. How can I plot multiple simulations on a single graph with transparency?
•	Reason for asking: In the new code, concentration curves for 1000 patients are plotted with semi-transparent lines (rgb(0, 0, 1, 0.1)), which makes it easier to visualize variability without overwhelming the plot.
